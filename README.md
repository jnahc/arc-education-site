## Overview

###### What is this ARC(Academy-Revolution-Confederation)?

We are the here to help students get with simple and manageable courses/lessons. By looking through our course list and making quick purchases. You will have access to all the course's and contents to get you to where you want to go.

**Our Wire Frame:**


# <img src="../static/img/wireframe1.jpg" height="60"> 
* Work with a group in a shared GitHub repository.
* Plan and implement a larger scale project as part of a development team.
* Integrate topics learned and experience gained in the course so far.
* Showcase your abilities to potential employers, friends, family, and community members.

**You will be working in groups of 4 for this project.**

## Planning & Deliverables

###### What will we be turning in?

### Project Planning Deliverables

**You must review the following with your instructional team BEFORE you start to code.**

* **Scope:** What are you planning to build? What do you reasonably think you can implement in the time period?
* **User Stories:** Who is your user? What features will your app have? Set up your project and user stories in <a href="https://trello.com" target="_blank">Trello</a> or in some other organized format.
* **Wireframes:** Sketch out what your core pages will look like and how they will work. Consider making a *paper prototype* to demonstrate and/or test key user interactions.
* **Data Models:** Draw out the models and any associations for your project in an entity relationship diagram (ERD).
* **Milestones:** Outline the milestones/sprints for your group.
* **Delegating Tasks:** What will each group member work on? Leverage everyone's strengths, and spend the majority of coding time pair programming.

### Completed Project Deliverables

* Link to Heroku hosted project, with all core technical requirements and three flexible technical requirements complete.
* Link to source code on GitHub.
* A `README.md` file with the following:
  * Description: Short paragraph (2-3 sentences) "elevator pitch" describing what your project does
  * Wireframes and user stories
  * Link to Heroku hosted project
  * Technologies (languages, external libraries, APIs)
  * Wish List / Future Development
  * Contributors (with links to their GitHub profiles)

## Technical Requirements

###### What technologies will we be using?

### Core Technical Requirements

**Every project must have all of the following requirements met to be considered complete:**

* **Django:** Use Django as the core framework for Python.
* **PostgreSQL:** Use PostgreSQL for your database in development and production.
* **Data Models** Include at least two data models with associations.
* **Data Validation:** Your application should validate incoming data before entering it into the database.
* **Error Handling:** Forms in your application should also validate data, handle incorrect inputs, and provide user feedback on the client side.
* **Views:** Use **partials** to follow DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) development in your views.
* **Home & About Pages:** Create a landing page (homepage) that clearly explains your app's value proposition and guides the user through the "get started" funnel. Create an about page that includes photos and brief bios of your team members.
* **User Experience:** Ensure a pleasing and logical user experience. Use a framework like Bootstrap to enhance and ease your CSS styling.
* **Responsive Design:** Make sure your app looks great on a phone or tablet.
* **Heroku:** Deploy your app to Heroku. Ensure no app secrets are exposed.
* **Github:** Projects must have a minimum of 60 specific commits.

### Flexible Technical Requirements

**Your app should have 3 out of the 5 following options:**

* **User Login** Make sure you have authentication *and* authorization.
* **AJAX** Use AJAX to communicate with the server without reloading the page when appropriate.
* **External APIs** Use  a third-party API back-end package to integrate third-party data into your app.
* **JavaScript & jQuery:** Add dynamic client-side behavior with event-driven functionality.
* **User-Friendly URLs:** Make pretty URLs that don't expose database IDs.

## Further Exploration

###### What if we want to do more?

If you want to push yourself and learn something new, optionally consider doing any of the following ideas. *Please talk to an instructor beforehand.*

* **Charting:** Visualize your data! Possibilities include D3, Morris.js, Highcharts, Chart.js, and Google Charts.
* **Job Scheduling:** Set up a job-scheduler to queue actions that don't need to run immediately.
* **Emails:** Use Django to send emails to your users.
* **Text Messaging:** Use Twilio to send texts to your users (note: not free).
* **Payment:** Use Stripe to allow your users to purchase from or donate to your site.
* **Material Design:** Research the material design paradigm and apply it to ground your app's UI in the physical realm.
* **CSS Animations:** Use jQuery or animate.css to include animations on your site.
* **Accessibility:** Research web accessibility (e.g. for blind users), and apply accessibility principles to your app.
* **Sessions:** Use sessions to store data for site visitors (who aren't necessarily logged in).
* **Search:** Build a form that allows users to search your data, based on attributes. Consider looking into Elasticsearch to speed up queries.
* **Whatever else you can think of!**
